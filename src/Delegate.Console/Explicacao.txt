Delegates are basically a cleaner, easier function pointer.

Advantages to using them in design:

Can lead to easy reuse of code
Can provide a great amount of flexibility in your designs
Allow you to develop libraries and classes that are easily extensible, since it provides an easy way to hook in other functionality (for example, a where clause in LINQ can use a delegate [Func<T,bool>] to filter on, without having to write new code in the Where method
Potential disadvantages:

They ~can~, particularly if used naively, lead to code that is more difficult to read
They can introduce behavior into your component that is unexpected, since 3rd party code out of your control will get called (For example, if somebody attaches a delegate to one of your events that causes an infinite loop, it can make your class look bad, even though it has nothing to do with you)
